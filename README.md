## TODO

1. Get the data from yfinance !DONE
2. Format the data !CURRENT

## ISSUES
- Is the data formatting correctly?
- Are we gathering enough data?
- Potental user errors even though were the only users

## STACK 

- yfinance for market data
- LightGBM for prediction model
- Pandas/Numpy for data cleaning
- Anthropic API (to get market sentiment)
- Streamlit for user interface (terminal for now)
